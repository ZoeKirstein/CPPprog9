initialize integers 'max', 'step', 'divisorOne', 'divisorTwo'
read in values for 'max', 'step', 'divisorOne', 'divisorTwo'

if 'max' or 'step' is less than or equal to zero, or divOne/divTwo is less than 2,
or if div1=div2,
print "Bad Input" w/ an endline, then exit program w/ a return value of zero.

initialize integer 'i' and define it as 1
if i is divisivle by 42, print 'answered' then exit

otherwise if i is divisble by the value in 'divisorOne' and the value in 'divisorTWo'
print "FizzBuzz"

otherwise if 'i' is divisble by only value in 'divisorOne' print 'Fizz'

otherwise if 'i' is divisible by only value in 'divisorTwo' print "Buzz"

otherwise print value in 'i'
